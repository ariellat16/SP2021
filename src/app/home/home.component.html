         ABOUT ME
       </h1>
       <p class="subtitle">
         Hello! My name is Michelle and I have traveled all around the United States for my job at CITIGroup. Recently, my job has given me the opportunity to travel to Dallas, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida in order to meet new clients. During my time in these cities I will be exploring local hotspots and ranking them by their popularity. I hope that this blog is able to help tourists, and locals, have a good time when visiting these cities.

        </h1>
        <p class="blogtext">
          This week I traveled to Jacksonville, Florida and I can't wait to share my trip with you guys. The city definitely lives up to its name! From its picteresque landscapes, diverse cuisines, and large community, Jacksonville is not a place to miss.

             Dallas, Texas: A Sociocultural Hub
           </h1>
           <p class="blogtext">
             To kick of my summer travels I spent a few weeks in Dallas, Texas and got to learn so much about the community! This city is the perfect mix of a cosmpolitian hub and suburban town. From outdoor activities to the huge architectural landscapes in downtown Dallas, this city has it all. Go check out the new Dallas page where I show you all the amazing places I went.
